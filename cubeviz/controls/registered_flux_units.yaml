# Define the following units on init

#   Define new units here. Add a name and base
#   for each unit. The base is an astropy unit and
#   should be kept as a sting that astropy.unit.Unit
#   understands. I there is no base for the new unit
#   only define the name key.

## Data Unit Registry
#
#  Registered units are stored below. Each key is
#  the unit as a sting and is broken down to its
#  numeric, spectral_flux_density and area components.
#  If a component is N/A, place an empty sting.
